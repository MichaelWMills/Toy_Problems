This repo contains a bunch of toy problems that I've solved for in my free time.

#1: Write a program that accepts a number and produces a spiral of numbers starting at its center, going outward that is equal in length to 2^n, where n is the input number.

Example#1: Input(3)
Output#1:
            5 4 3
            6 1 2
            7 8 9

Ex#2:      Input(4)
Out#2:
            16 15 14 13
             5  4  3 12
             6  1  2 11
             7  8  9 10
